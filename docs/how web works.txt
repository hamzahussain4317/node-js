basically our web pages is store somewhere in the server or it code is store somewhere when 
you open that webpage its code loads from there the browser is just like our interpreter that gets back certain source
code when we request for data through http the data is encrypted between browser and the server
javascript code is only understand by the browser and the goofle engine provide v8 engine written in c++
which understands js code and run it node js is written in c++
a server side language can read and write files on computer also connects to a database and act as a server of content

global objects of javascript all of them have their own methods attributes etc.
1)window
settimeout is the method of window object thats why we dont write window.settimeout instead it we use just settimeout


                                                                 node js introduction
what if we want to link two js file we can do by using the code
const xyz=require('./people')
it can run the code on file people but cannot acces the things created in people like if we create an aray in people we cannot console.log(people) in this file
so for that we have to import tat thing in people file and in this case xyz contain that people array
otherwise it contain an empty object
 
                                                                file system in node js
read file: for reading a file in js we have a method of a readfile('file name proper path',callback function that do something when it works)	
remember that reding a file is a async function that always been run asynchoronsly

write to a file: for writing a file in js we have a method of a writefile('file name proper path','content we want to write,call function that runs asynchoronsly
after it writes the content into the file)
remember that writing to a file is a async function that always been run asynchoronsly

streams: starts using data before the file fully being read 
the good example of a stream is a youtube video means that the we can see video without full been loaded means that we donot wait to video to been fully load 

                                                                Server side js
request: what browser send to the server
response: what server send back to the browser
for example when we give a website name to the browser then the browser request to the server through the following IP and the in the response the server loads the
website that communication between a server and a brwoser is thorugh a HTTP 
when you access web through its IP address your own computer acts as a localhost
localhost: is nothing but just a domain name of the web
port number: is nothing but your computer door through which internet communication is made
